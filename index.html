        <h1><span>Science </span>and Climate Change</h1>

        <p>This presentation is all about the rising effects of climate change on us and how what the scientific topics we are currently studying have to do with it. Climate change, as we all know is an issue that has been under close watch for a number of years. Climate change, also called global warming, refers to the rise in average surface temperatures on Earth. An overwhelming scientific consensus maintains that climate change is due primarily to the human use of fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the air. The gases trap heat within the atmosphere, which can have a range of effects on ecosystems, including rising sea levels, severe weather events, and droughts that render landscapes more susceptible to wildfires. This presentation aims to show you some of the scientific ways in which Climate Change crosses over with our syllabus. And I hope that as you go on, you enjoy this wonderful presentation.<br><br><span class="line1"> Now lets delve</span> <span class="line2"><br><br>Into The Presentation</span></p>
